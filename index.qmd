title: "Machine Learning in R with {tidymodels}"
---

A three-hour workshop introducing the basic concepts of and applied skills for predictive machine learning in R. Developed and instructed by [Jeffrey Girard](https://github.com/jmgirard) for the [Technology in Psychiatry Summit](https://home.mcleanhospital.org/tips) (October 26, 2022).

This workshop will provide a hands-on introduction to the application of predictive machine learning in R using the [{tidymodels}](https://www.tidymodels.org) packages. It will emphasize practical knowledge and conceptual intuitions (e.g., teaching you how to drive a car) rather than technical and theoretical mastery (e.g., teaching you how to build a car). It will cover the basic [{tidymodels}](https://www.tidymodels.org) workflow from data splitting and feature engineering to hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and model evaluation. Basic knowledge of R (e.g., simple data structures and importing data) will be assumed but no previous experience with machine learning will be necessary.
