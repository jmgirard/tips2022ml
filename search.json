    "text": "This workshop will provide a hands-on introduction to the application of predictive machine learning in R using the {tidymodels} packages. It will emphasize practical knowledge and conceptual intuitions (e.g., teaching you how to drive a car) rather than technical and theoretical mastery (e.g., teaching you how to build a car). It will cover the basic {tidymodels} workflow from data splitting and feature engineering to hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and model evaluation. Basic knowledge of R (e.g., simple data structures and importing data) will be assumed but no previous experience with machine learning will be necessary.\n\nThese materials may be re-used according to the CC-BY License."
